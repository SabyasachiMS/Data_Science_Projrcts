Again it seems\\n  that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\\n  arrivals figures.\\n      Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\\n  much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\\n  practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\\n  around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\\n  are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\\n  middlemen, exporters and processors.\\n      There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\\n  for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\\n  obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\\n      In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\\n  sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\\n      Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\\n  cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\\n      Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\\n  only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\\n  1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\\n      New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\\n  June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\\n  under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\\n  per tonne FOB.\\n      Routine sales of butter were made.

There\\'s no real\\n  reason for it to change policy,\" said Joseph Liro of S.G.\\n  Warburg and Co Inc.\\n      Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does\\n  not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates\\n  may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.\\n      All of the economists agreed that the Fed\\'s major concern\\n  now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was\\n  heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting\\n  the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering\\n  interest rates further.\\n      Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with\\n  expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.\\n      The Fed said that banks\\' net free reserves averaged 603 mln\\n  dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday\\n  versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.\\n      In the single week to Wednesday, banks\\' borrowings at the\\n  discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs\\n  compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement\\n  period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to\\n  6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.\\n      The Fed\\'s failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday\\n  and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data\\n  released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.\\n      The Fed\\'s absence may be explained by the lack of any\\n  pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to\\n  boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to\\n  meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.\\n      Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week\\n  borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually\\n  averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that\\n  was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.\\n      Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for\\n  two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln\\n  dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of\\n  around 6.10 pct.\\n      It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings\\n  target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said\\n  Wells Fargo\\'s Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on\\n  the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to\\n  6-1/4 pct band.\\n      Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need\\n  are anticipated for the statement period that began today.\\n   More\\n      Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four\\n  billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro\\n  puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.\\n      To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to\\n  add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to\\n  buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar\\n  coupon \"pass\" may be required later.\\n      There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement\\n  period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further\\n  upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window\\n  dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY\\n  Recent slackness on Dutch capital\\n  markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank\\'s\\n  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark\\n  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.\\n      While agreeing with the Bank\\'s commitment to defend the\\n  guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use\\n  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can\\n  fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System\\n  (EMS).\\n      Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV\\n  (Amro) said the Central Bank\\'s policy was overcautious.\\n      \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the\\n  range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the\\n  presentation of Amro\\'s 1986 annual report last week.\\n      Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against\\n  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.\\n      The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to\\n  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a\\n  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\\n  policies to influence the exchange rate.\\n      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\\n  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\\n      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\\n      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\\n  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\\n  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\\n  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\\n  obtain.\"\\n      Amro\\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\\n  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\\n  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\\n  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\\n  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\\n  added.\\n      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\\n  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\\n  Bank\\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\\n  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\\n  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\\n      \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\\n  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\\n      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\\n  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the\\n  two does not differ much, economists said.\\n      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\\n  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\\n  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\\n  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\\n      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\\n  and exchange rates.\\n      West Germany is the Netherlands\\' largest single trading\\n  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\\n  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\\n  Statistics figures show.\\n      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\\n  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\\n  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.\\n      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\\n  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\\n  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\\n      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\\n  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\\n  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\\n  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\\n  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\\n      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\\n  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\\n  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\\n      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\\n  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\\n  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\\n  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\\n  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\\n      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\\n  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\\n      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\\n  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\\n  narrow.\\n      \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\\n  between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the\\n  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell\\n  large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director\\n  Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.\\n      \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the\\n  markets would start to believe it was weak.

Libya was also a buyer\\n  this week, taking two cargoes of whites which, for an\\n  undisclosed shipment period, were reported priced around\\n  229/230 dlrs a tonne cost and freight, they added.\\n      Futures prices reacted upwards to the news of end-buyer\\n  physicals offtake, although much of the enquiry emerged\\n  recently when prices took an interim technical dip, traders\\n  said.\\n      Pakistan is lined up shortly to buy 100,000 tonnes of\\n  whites although traders said the tender, originally scheduled\\n  for tomorrow, might not take place until a week later.\\n      Egypt will be seeking 20,000 tonnes of May arrival white\\n  sugar next week, while Greece has called an internal EC tender\\n  for 40,000 tonnes of whites to be held in early April, for\\n  arrival in four equal parts in May, June, July and August.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

By January, its estimate of 1986\\n  planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.\\n      Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in\\n  1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year\\'s good\\n  demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts\\n  said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.\\n      \"With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is\\n  going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.\\n  Soybeans are dirt cheap,\" said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill\\n  Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton\\n  market specialists.\\n      Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to\\n  increased acreage, analysts said.\\n      They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers\\n  who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans\\n  were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in\\n  government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government\\n  will not pick up the tab for storage.\\n      Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from\\n  participating in the program, which could result in more\\n  cotton. \"The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of\\n  25 pct of a farmer\\'s base acreage,\" noted Judy Weissman of\\n  Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to\\n  participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage \\n  they have.\\n      Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding\\n  Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the\\n  program. \"Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct,\" said\\n  one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part\\n  on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its\\n  annual meeting in late January.\\n      But others disagreed. \"I think some Western growers have\\n  decided they should be in the program for security reasons.\\n  There\\'s a lot of comfort in knowing you\\'ll be guaranteed the\\n  government\\'s loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the\\n  program is subject to the wiles of the market,\" said Walter\\n  Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.\\n      Some cotton specialists said their expectations for\\n  increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday\\'s planting\\n  intentions report. \"Anything the USDA is announcing now is\\n  based on information they gathered before their cotton program\\n  was announced (on March 20),\" one analyst cautioned. She said\\n  traders will get a better idea of next year\\'s cotton output\\n  when the USDA\\'s planted acreage report is released on July 9.\\n      Brown took that opinion a step further. \"I don\\'t think\\n  planted acreage is important.

       " \"NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE\\n  The London Metal Exchange's, LME,\\n  decision to introduce a dollar-denominated aluminium contract,\\n  with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point, is a\\n  positive move, physical traders and LME dealers said.\\n      Earlier this week the LME declared that a 99.70 pct minimum\\n  purity aluminium contract would commence trading on June 1,\\n  1987, alongside its long-established sterling-based 99.50 pct\\n  contract.\\n      This is the LME's first dollar contract and non-European\\n  delivery point, and the Board and Committee are looking at\\n  Singapore as a delivery point for other contracts.\\n      Trade sources said the LME's new contract will conform with\\n  existing industry practice, where 99.70 standard re-melt\\n  material, priced in dollars, is most commonly traded.\\n      The location of a warehouse in Singapore is also a positive\\n  move by the LME, given its ideal location for Australian and\\n  Japanese traders, who would be able to place metal on to\\n  warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively, they said.\\n      Hedging during the LME ring sessions becomes much simpler\\n  with a dollar contract. At present pre-market trading is almost\\n  exclusively dollar-based, but currency conversions have to be\\n  done during the sterling rings, they added.\\n      LME ring dealers said the new contract would match more\\n  closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the\\n  recent wide backwardations.\\n      Very little physical business is now done in 99.50 pct\\n  purity metal, nearly all of which is produced in Eastern Bloc\\n  countries, such as Romania.\\n      The Soviet Union also produces 99.50 pct, but has declined\\n  as an exporter recently, they said.\\n      Some dealers said the new 99.70 contract may suffer from\\n  liquidity problems initially, as business may continue to\\n  centre on the present good ordinary brand (gob) contract, where\\n  there are many holders of large short positions on the LME.\\n      But others said the new contract would soon attract trading\\n  interest, given that much 99.70 metal has already been\\n  attracted to the LME's warehouses by backwardations.\\n      The LME also has a much more viable liquidity base for a\\n  new contract, compared to the Comex market in New York, where\\n  high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active, they\\n  said.\\n      Thus, it seems likely that the sterling contract will\\n  eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline. Like\\n  standard zinc, which was superseded by a high grade contract,\\n  gob aluminium will probably be replaced, although the process\\n  in this case may take longer, they added.\\n      Forming a new contract and establishing a Singapore\\n  warehouse are constructive moves by the LME but backwardations,\\n  which make physical trading difficult, would not totally\\n  disappear as a result, the trade sources said.\\n      These premiums for prompt metal have become a\\n  semi-permanent feature over the last year, due to increased\\n  business and volatility in traded options, and are presently\\n  around 50 stg.\\n      Increasingly large granting of option positions has been\\n  taking place. When some of these are declared and exercised at\\n  the end of the relevant month, physical tightness and squeezes\\n  around these dates are commonplace, they said.\\n      Listing Singapore as a delivery point allows Far Eastern\\n  operators to deliver aluminium into a LME warehouse instead of\\n  having to cover.\\n      But tightness and backwardations are seen continuing, even\\n  though the LME's new option contracts widen the gap between the\\n  declaration and prompt dates.\\n      These will be due on the first and third Wednesday of the\\n  month, whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th.\\n      Backwardations will remain while operators continue to\\n  grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds\\n  aluminium stock levels, an LME option trader said.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

But a Matsushita\\n  Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in\\n  imports was not likely.\\n      Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if\\n  the United States did implement the tariffs, which would be\\n  levied on consumer electronics products rather than on\\n  microchips themselves.\\n      \"If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time,\\n  there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States,\"\\n  said Tom Murtha, analyst at James Capel and Co.\\n      \"The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be\\n  stopped altogether, but recovery for the industry will be\\n  delayed for another year,\" he said.\\n      Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by\\n  stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan\\n  for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here.\\n      \"The American approach is full of contradictions,\" Jardine\\n  Fleming\\'s Edwards said.\\n      \"If they want to expand (U.S.) exports, the last thing they\\n  want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that\\n  hurts the final market,\" Edwards said.\\n      But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S.\\n  Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry, but also\\n  frustration with Japan\\'s vast trade surplus. Some analysts\\n  argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have\\n  to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact.\\n      Carole Ryavec, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd,\\n  said \"The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic\\n  economy and move away from an export-dependent economy.\"\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and\\n  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of\\n  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.\\n      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha\\n  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been \"almost completely\\n  devastated,\" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now\\n  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally\\n  expected.\\n      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high\\n  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate\\n  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.\\n      \"Should the present drought continue, however, production is\\n  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,\" the letter added.\\n      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90\\n  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last\\n  year\\'s output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.\\n      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected\\n  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because\\n  subsidiary crops had also failed.\\n      It said the government\\'s current budget did not permit it\\n  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.\\n  \"Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity\\n  prices and slowing of the economy.

Its focus is to\\n  force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign\\n  competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win\\n  temporary relief from surges in imports.\\n      The most controversial issue, an amendment to restrict\\n  imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not\\n  buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House.\\n      Rep.

As a result, the\\n  market became glutted,\" said one trader.\\n      He said the window depends more on supply than on foreign\\n  exchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment.\\n  \"Obviously, currency risk is important. But there is a limited\\n  number of investors right now for the paper,\" he said.\\n      On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mln\\n  New Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes\\n  issued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co &lt;F>.\\n      The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, and\\n  quarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day New\\n  Zealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life.\\n      This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offering\\n  of the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical\\n  Co &lt;DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set on\\n  April 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below\\n  the same 90-day New Zealand rate.\\n      Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate\\n  floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,\\n  underwriters said.\\n      But the Ford Credit notes and Friday\\'s offering of 130 mln\\n  New Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by\\n  General Electric Co\\'s &lt;GE> General Electric Credit Corp via\\n  Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.\\n      \"Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters\\n  and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply,\" an\\n  underwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted\\n  that the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.\\n      An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed\\n  out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow\\n  did, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.\\n      Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date\\n  first surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,\\n  companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a\\n  foreign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But\\n  the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.\\n      \"I would say that every company which issued foreign\\n  currency debt saved some basis points when compared to\\n  same-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues,\" an analyst said.\\n      Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early\\n  issues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to\\n  absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides\\n  posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such\\n  issuance to a quick halt.\\n      It was not until late last year, after the currencies\\n  stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt\\n  denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.\\n      But many investors have still shied away from the debt,\\n  remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New\\n  Zealand dollars, analysts noted.\\n      To attract some of those investors back to the fold,\\n  underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign\\n  currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.\\n      This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the\\n  course of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and\\n  predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields\\n  would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.\\n      A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford\\n  Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day\\n  of offering. \"That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New\\n  Zealand dollar note issues,\" he said.\\n      However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate\\n  said the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache\\n  did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.\\n      They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by\\n  Moody\\'s Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor\\'s, while\\n  the General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate\\n  terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried\\n  top-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.\\n      \"We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-day\\n  sales on a Friday afternoon, I\\'m happy with the results,\" an\\n  officer on Prudential-Bache\\'s syndicate desk said.\\n      Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign\\n  currency-denominated notes, underwriters said.\\n      Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of New\\n  Zealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few\\n  weeks away.\\n      \"I would like to underwrite a deal a day.

       " 'FED\\'S POLICY EASE MAY END WITH 2ND QTR RATE CUT\\n  The Federal Reserve\\'s move to easier\\n  monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate\\n  cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the\\n  second quarter, analysts said.\\n      A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to\\n  edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate\\n  from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.\\n      \"The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without\\n  a full-blown recession,\" said Raymond Stone, chief financial\\n  economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.\\n      Stone said economic data available by late June may be just\\n  weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said\\n  it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half\\n  point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.\\n      All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market\\n  Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.\\n      The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly\\n  quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury\\n  bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which\\n  banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime\\n  lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.\\n      Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to\\n  the April-June quarter, follow:\\n      - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further\\n  against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget\\n  deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after\\n  the dollar\\'s steep drop in the last two business days, the\\n  economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that\\n  the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.\\n      - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue\\n  trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well\\n  test the lower end of that range.\\n      - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and\\n  probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong\\n  foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The\\n  outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year\\n  since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.\\n      - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator\\n  will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The\\n  sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will\\n  a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.\\n      - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct\\n  annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at\\n  respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first\\n  and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct\\n  annual\\n  rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.\\n      Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees\\n  both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among\\n  those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct\\n  rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this\\n  quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.\\n      \"The economy will bounce back more strongly than many\\n  expect,\" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in\\n  inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter\\n  economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.\\n      \"We\\'re running out of special factors to keep the economy\\n  afloat,\" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His\\n  interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.\\n      Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation\\n  helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.\\n  He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second\\n  quarter growth could be zero or negative.\\n      Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer\\n  from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow \\n  government spending and less construction. Only a marginally\\n  narrower trade deficit will add to growth.\\n      He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,\\n  with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,\\n  respectively. Nikko\\'s Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for\\n  bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.\\n      Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly\\n  after the dollar\\'s fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past\\n  days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.\\n      David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc\\n  raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20\\n  pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.\\n      Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted\\n  his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point\\n  to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and\\n  Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.\\n      The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese\\n  investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear\\n  about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.\\n  trade sanctions.

But U.S. Charges of unfair trade\\n  practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold.\\n      The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit\\n  with Japan last year, and seeks redress when it feels Japanese\\n  trade policy hurts Europeans, diplomats and economists said.\\n      But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting\\n  with the U.S. To do something about Japan\\'s huge trade surplus.\\n      \"The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the\\n  U.S.,\" said Martin Wolf, director of studies at the Trade Policy\\n  Research Centre in London. \"Basically, their policies are pretty\\n  much the same.\"\\n      But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S., Or\\n  that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of\\n  the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims, Wolf said.Basically,\\n  Europeans have a different approach to trade problems, he said.\\n      \"In the U.S., People talk about fair trade, but not here,\" he\\n  added. \"In the U.S., It all has to do with the general ethic of\\n  free competition, while in Europe, the general approach is that\\n  liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich.\"\\n      Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington\\'s\\n  tendency to impose so-called \"countervailing duties\" - an import\\n  tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair.\\n      In Western Europe, the approach to trade disputes tends to\\n  be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation, Wolf said.\\n      In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row, President Reagan has\\n  threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic\\n  goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs, alleging that Japan has\\n  failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade.\\n      But the European Community has challenged the agreement as\\n  a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\\n  practices that discriminates against its microchip producers.\\n      \"It follows that they\\'re not likely to rally to the side of\\n  the United States in defence of the agreement,\" said Wolf.\\n      Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough\\n  line on Japanese trade issues, government officials in the rest\\n  of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take\\n  the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row.\\n      A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told\\n  Reuters there has been no change in the Community\\'s position\\n  since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a\\n  strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances.\\n      In a statement issued after that meeting, EC foreign\\n  ministers deplored Japan\\'s continued trade imbalance and\\n  appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets.\\n      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after\\n  the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC.\\n      Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no\\n  signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging\\n  sanctions against Japan. The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a\\n  trade war, they said.\\n      Instead, the Community is trying to target problem areas in\\n  European trade with Japan, including wines and spirits,\\n  cosmetics, and financial services, and will continue talking to\\n  try to improve the situation, the diplomats said.\\n      In Britain, where the government is angered over the\\n  difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has\\n  faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market, officials said\\n  last week that retaliatory action is being considered.\\n      But government officials said last night, \"We are not\\n  talking about days or weeks.

The ATPC\\n  launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes\\n  for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from\\n  70,000.\\n      Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and\\n  delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told\\n  Reuters in London, \"Agreements with economic clauses to\\n  stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were\\n  close to market reality, if there was full participation by\\n  producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to\\n  take their obligations in the framework of the agreement\\n  seriously.\"\\n      But Baron added, \"No real sanctions are available for a\\n  country that doesn\\'t stick to its obligations...The German\\n  approach is sceptical. We don\\'t think agreements are the best\\n  instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant\\n  to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how\\n  developing countries often interpret them.\"\\n      Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of\\n  commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third\\n  World producing countries. But recently demands for more\\n  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the\\n  need for \"intellectual honesty\" and \"objective criteria\" have\\n  grown.\\n      British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be\\n  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.\\n      It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct\\n  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree\\n  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended\\n  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K.\\n  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to\\n  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather\\n  than dictate what prices should be.\\n      A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price\\n  realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply.\\n      A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable\\n  to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of\\n  sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real\\n  market situation, particularly regarding stocks.\\n      Indonesia\\'s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told\\n  Reuters in Jakarta: \"These agreements can work as long as the\\n  problems are cyclical..But it\\'s another matter when there are\\n  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity\\n  agreements as an act of faith.\" Nicaraguan External Trade\\n  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers\\n  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity\\n  agreements.\\n      \"The political will is not there on the part of some\\n  consumers to make agreements work,\" Martinez Cuenca said.\\n      The head of the economics department in the Brazilian\\n  Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an\\n  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market\\n  reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system\\n  of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact\\n  and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham\\n  Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings\\n  enhance developing countries\\' ability to service debt and mean\\n  greater demand for industrialised nations\\' capital goods.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

But liquidity was tight in early business because\\n  banks excessively took up the Bundesbank\\'s offer for sale of\\n  Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for\\n  three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.\\n      Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,\\n  flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return\\n  until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.\\n      Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,\\n  commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five\\n  billion marks or so.\\n      With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the\\n  month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,\\n  draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought\\n  funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess\\n  funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.\\n      One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced\\n  knowledge of the market\\'s needs, should have curtailed its\\n  sales of treasury bills on Friday.\\n      Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total\\n  minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank\\n  has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate\\n  the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.\\n      \"(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not\\n  selling any treasury bills or we\\'re not selling them in this\\n  amount,\" he said. \"If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the\\n  market then they should avoid such excesses.

The institute had made the revision\\n  due to poor prospects for Austrian exports, he added.\\n      A collapse in sales to the Eastern European and oil\\n  producing states, combined with the effects of the dollar's\\n  fall, mean exports overall are unlikely to rise this year.\\n      Kramer said domestic demand alone would fuel growth this\\n  year. After last year's 2.8 pct rise in real incomes, private\\n  consumption was likely to rise 2.25 pct in 1987 after 1.9 pct\\n  in 1986, despite a present trend towards higher savings.\\n      Unemployment was likely to rise to almost six pct from 5.2\\n  pct last year due to the slack economic activity.\\n      Kramer said the current account was likely to run a deficit\\n  of about four billion schillings compared with a 2.6 billion\\n  surplus recorded last year. The National Bank, Austria's\\n  central bank, last month forecast the current account would be\\n  roughly in balance this year.\\n      However, Kramer said the lower economic growth should have\\n  no notable effect on the government's attempts to cut the\\n  budget deficit.

Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine\\n  pct.\\n      Analysts believe Pacific Western\\'s aggressive and\\n  cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true\\n  potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four\\n  decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific\\n  Ltd.\\n      They said CP Air\\'s management style had been not much\\n  different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because\\n  neither airline was held accountable to its owners.\\n      \"Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these\\n  two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither\\n  seemed that concerned about the bottom line,\" said Bradley.\\n      \"But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very\\n  conscious of profitability and shareholder return.

It has a debt of more\\n  than 2 billion dlrs.\\n      Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to\\n  the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of\\n  increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more\\n  attention to finances, analysts said.\\n      It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit \"in\\n  excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs\" for 1986. However, this profit\\n  recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that\\n  all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.\\n      Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,\\n  attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in\\n  Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.\\n      For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air\\n  traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from\\n  cost-cutting and careful spending.\\n      Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said\\n  institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their\\n  portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new\\n  competition makes profit growth less certain.\\n      \"The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At\\n  one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody\\n  else\\'s,\" Friend said.\\n      Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline\\n  shares for at least a year.\\n      Analysts said Air Canada\\'s immediate concern ahead of a\\n  public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes\\n  without setting off a political storm.\\n      It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary\\n  updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.\\n      Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,\\n  already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of\\n  a dozen aircraft from Europe\\'s Airbus Industrie.\\n      Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered\\n  six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would\\n  soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the\\n  Boeing Co.\\n      Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,\\n  needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without\\n  hurting profits.\\n      Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian\\n  Airlines\\' profit in 1988 will more than double last year\\'s 29.8\\n  mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Around a third of\\n  any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the\\n  Japanese. However, Japanese investors have lost money as the\\n  dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it\\n  fall further to cut the trade deficit. The counterpart of\\n  improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or\\n  because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods,\\n  may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget\\n  deficit.\\n     And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall, the Japanese will\\n  have less money to invest. To entice U.S. Investors to fill the\\n  gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S.\\n  Bonds, interest rates would have to soar, O\\'Brien said. The\\n  subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls\\n  on the world stock markets.\\n      \"A year ago, we could be pretty confident about the markets,\"\\n  said O\\'Brien. \"Now, it is much less certain.\"\\n      Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming\\n  economy. But the world economy, with sluggish growth at best in\\n  the industrial nations, a massive load of Third World debt and\\n  huge trade imbalances is not in good shape, said O\\'Brien.\\n      Nevertheless, New York analyst William Raferty, of Smith\\n  Barney Harris Upham said  \"We\\'re still in a bull market,\" adding\\n  that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and \"The\\n  bear usually strikes slowly.\"\\n      Economist Evelyn Brody, at Morgan Grenfell and Co in\\n  London, said the huge sums of money going through the world\\n  financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices.\\n      Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in\\n  non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it\\'s very\\n  difficult to see where else they can put their money than in\\n  U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury (bond) market,\\n  according to David Butcher, a senior executive at Yamaichi\\n  Securities Co Ltd\\'s bond operation in London.\\n      He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now\\n  to the French franc and West German mark.\\n      In the longer run, he worries about what trade tensions and\\n  the dollar\\'s slide will mean for securities markets.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Last week, Jacobs\\' investment vehicle,\\n  Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln\\n  Borg-Warner shares.

Most analysts said they\\n  think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.\\n      Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on\\n  its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.\\n      Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up\\n  with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials\\n  company in some other way.

That helped boost\\n  U.S. chemical exports.\\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\\n  in the early 1980s.\\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \\n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\\n      \"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\\n  deteriorated,\" Dosher said. \"But I think they will eventually\\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\\n  market.\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\\n      \"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\" GAF\\'s Heyman\\n  cautioned. \"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\\n  ill-advised.

The\\n  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\\n  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\\n      Heineken\\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\\n  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\\n  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\\n      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\\n  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\\n  into the closed West German market -- Europe\\'s biggest beer\\n  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\\n  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\\n  point,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\\n  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\\n      \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\\n  market, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\\n  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\\n  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\\n  regionalized.\\n       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\\n  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\\n  important beer growth markets in the long term.\\n       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\\n  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\\n  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\\n      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\\n  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\\n  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\\n  1986 sales.\\n      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\\n  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\\n  have been looking at other possibilities.\\n      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\\n  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\\n  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.\\n      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\\n  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\\n  popular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\\n  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\\n      Chairman Heineken said the company\\'s seven year efforts to\\n  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\\n  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\\n      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\\'s\\n  market potential.

But Volcker\\n  has warned that a further fall in the dollar\\'s value is fraught\\n  with danger.\\n      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\\n  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\\n  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\\n      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\\n  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\\n  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\\n  should be stabilized at around current levels.\\n      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\\n  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\\n  agreed to cut its budget deficit.\\n      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\\n  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\\n  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\\n      \"If you don\\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything else\\n  you do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\\n  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\\n      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\\n  government\\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\\n  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\\n  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\\n  States.\\n      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\\n  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\\n      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\\n  that any deficit reduction was better than none.\\n      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \\n  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\\n  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\\n  from plunging further in world exchange markets.\\n      \"There\\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\\n  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\\n  Fed\\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\\n  is, it\\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\\n      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\\'s\\n  most vexing and persistent problems.\\n      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\\n  little indication that this year\\'s figure will be any lower,\\n  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by\\n  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\\'s end.\\n      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\\n  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\\n  federal budget.\\n      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\\n  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\\n  the 1986-1991 period by last year\\'s Gramm-Rudman balanced\\n  budget law.\\n      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\\n  next year\\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\\n  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\\n  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\\n      \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\\n  most you\\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\\n  said Touche Ross\\'s Collander. \"To do something more than that\\n  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\\n      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\\n  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\\n      \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\\n  reduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\\n  look like a failure to Wall Street.\"\\n      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\\n  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\\n  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\\n  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\\n  anticipated spending levels for next year.\\n      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\\n  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \\n  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

He added that West German growth forecasts would\\n  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\\n  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\\n      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\\n  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and\\n  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\\n  determined market trends.\\n      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\\n  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\\n  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\\n      \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\\n  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\\n  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\\n  mounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\\n      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\\n  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\\n  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.\\n      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\\n  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\\n  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\\n  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\\n  make itself felt compared with the price effect.\\n      \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\\n  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account\\n  over the medium term,\" Koehler said.\\n      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\\n  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\\n  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\\n  rise faster than GNP.\\n      \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\\n      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\\n  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\\n  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\\n      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\\n  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial\\n  investment in the U.S.\\n      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\\n  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\\n  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\\n      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\\n  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\\n  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\\n  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.\\n      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\\n  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also\\n  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate\\n  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\\n      A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\\n  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international\\n  monetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\\n      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\\n  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\\n  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\\n  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,\\n  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.\\n      In order to keep the international monetary system free of\\n  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\\n  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

They saw near-term technical support at 1.825\\n  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.\\n      Chase Bank\\'s Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said\\n  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable\\n  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme\\n  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.\\n      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the\\n  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a\\n  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.\\n      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to\\n  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre\\n  accord\\'s supposed currency target range.\\n      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were\\n  ready for a period of \"mainly sideways movement.\"\\n      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique\\n  contributing to greater stability.\\n      \"Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big\\n  boost,\" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he\\n  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks\\n  in the next three months.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The yen sank below 145 at one point\\n  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.\\n      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan\\'s Finance Minister, said the\\n  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading\\n  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.\\n      \"I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past\\n  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the\\n  discussions in Paris,\" Miyazawa said yesterday.\\n      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was\\n  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of\\n  Miyazawa\\'s departure for Washington, to attend yesterday\\'s\\n  meetings of leading industrial nations.\\n      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action\\n  \"extraordinary and urgent\", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris\\n  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges\\n  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.\\n      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West\\n  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore\\n  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to\\n  foster exchange rate stability.\\n      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central\\n  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the\\n  dollar\\'s fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of\\n  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent\\n  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that\\n  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely\\n  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.\\n      They also said there was a growing feeling among the\\n  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over\\n  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term\\n  differences in past meetings.\\n      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like\\n  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of\\n  yesterday\\'s statement to have won acceptance from other\\n  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.\\n      Bonn\\'s finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that\\n  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance\\n  between West Germany and Japan\\'s trade surpluses and America\\'s\\n  trade deficit have already taken place.\\n      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut\\n  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the\\n  reafffirmation of Paris.\\n      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are\\n  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that\\n  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.\\n      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this\\n  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further\\n  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would \"clearly pose\\n  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could\\n  undermine confidence in future financial stability,\" he said.\\n      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the\\n  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.\\n      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany\\n  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own\\n  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.\\n      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak\\n  dollar blunts Tokyo\\'s export drive to the United States, the\\n  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.\\n      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making\\n  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian\\n  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.\\n      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit\\n  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.\\n      The United States and France, backed by the International\\n  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or \"norms\" for a\\n  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,\\n  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current\\n  account balances.\\n      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in\\n  consultations between the countries on whether corrective\\n  action should be required.\\n      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives\\n  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it\\n  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.\\n      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully\\n  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit\\n  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.\\n      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges\\n  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the\\n  relatively free currency markets of recent years.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

This cut producer stocks\\n  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\\n  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\\n  a regular supplier to the world market.\\n      Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\\n  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\\n      On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\\n  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\\n  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\\n  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\\n  order was filled by merchants in March.\\n      Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\\n  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\\n  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\\n  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\\n  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\\n  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\\n      On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\\n  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\\n  and this is believed to be in strong hands.\\n      Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\\n  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\\n  which are not popular with merchants putting together\\n  shipments.\\n      But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\\n  the start of the year.

It added\\n  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of\\n  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves\\n  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.\\n      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the\\n  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on\\n  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday\\'s\\n  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.\\n      \"It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at\\n  this time,\" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.\\n      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi\\n  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest\\n  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak\\n  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the\\n  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.\\n      \"Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest\\n  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar\\n  tumbled,\" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.\\n      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new\\n  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday\\'s\\n  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed\\n  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.\\n      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in\\n  Wednesday\\'s G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that\\n  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade\\n  imbalance between the United States and Japan.\\n      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for\\n  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average\\n  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct.

Interest rates fell\\n  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.\\n      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial\\n  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker\\'s\\n  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.\\n      \"Volcker\\'s been saying for a long time that a dollar\\n  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he\\'s got it,\" said\\n  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.\\n      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in\\n  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington\\n  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a\\n  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short\\n  of further depreciation of the dollar.\\n      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid\\n  worries that the dollar\\'s slide will rekindle inflation, scare\\n  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.\\n      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12\\n  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike\\n  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down\\n  by 33 points to 2339.\\n      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the\\n  markets\\' instability frightening. He believes economic\\n  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that \"once\\n  you start the ball rolling it\\'s difficult to stop.\"\\n      \"There\\'s a stark possibility that you could get a\\n  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates\\n  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.\"\\n      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics\\n  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the\\n  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and\\n  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.\\n      \"We\\'re still more or less on track for a hard landing... But\\n  the agony may be fairly drawn out,\" Marris told Reuters.\\n      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this\\n  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it\\n  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second\\n  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the\\n  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.\\n      The stock market\\'s reaction today and its sharp drop on\\n  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.\\n      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with\\n  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are\\n  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its\\n  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.\\n      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar\\'s latest\\n  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks\\n  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling\\n  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as\\n  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.\\n      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of\\n  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced\\n  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic\\n  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.\\n      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not\\n  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is\\n  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the\\n  massive budget deficit.\\n      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of\\n  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no\\n  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.\\n      \"The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a\\n  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding\\n  cut abroad, at least by Japan,\" said Lanston\\'s Jones.\\n      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest\\n  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for\\n  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.\\n      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and\\n  Co, scoffed at the notion. \"It\\'s ridiculous to think the Federal\\n  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak\\n  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar\\n  weakness,\" he said.\\n      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being\\n  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.\\n      \"We\\'re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the\\n  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody\\n  cares,\" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69\\n  will have been greater.\\n      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and\\n  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.\\n      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that\\n  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. \"Put on\\n  your helmets,\" Giordano said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON\\n  Major U.S. banks may lift prime\\n  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in\\n  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is\\n  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.\\n      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most\\n  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to\\n  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own\\n  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.\\n      \"A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,\"\\n  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.\\n      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is\\n  justified because the spread between banks\\' cost of funds and\\n  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a\\n  percentage point.\\n      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage\\n  points since last October until it fell below one point and\\n  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.\\n      \"We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon\\n  as this week,\" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.\\n      \"We\\'ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the\\n  near future,\" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.\\n      \"Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding\\n  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,\"\\n  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.\\n      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime\\n  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan\\n  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain\\n  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.\\n      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift\\n  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He\\n  said \"if there is widespread belief money market rates will\\n  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.\"\\n      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a\\n  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar\\n  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders\\n  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.\\n      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to\\n  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.\\n  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.\\n      Based particularly on the Fed\\'s reserve management actions\\n  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said \"it has become\\n  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure\\n  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.\"\\n      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest\\n  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation\\n  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.\\n      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the\\n  market than most economists had expected.\\n      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small\\n  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements\\n  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another\\n  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct\\n  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr\\n  round of customer repurchase agreements.\\n      \"The Fed\\'s actions on Friday and today show that it is\\n  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,\"\\n  said Jones of Lanston.\\n      \"The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the\\n  need to defend the dollar,\" Jones said. He believes it is\\n  merely shading policy toward restraint now, \"but to have a\\n  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy\\n  overtly at some point.\"\\n      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by\\n  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within\\n  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.\\n      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might\\n  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to\\n  further aid the dollar.\\n      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on\\n  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate\\n  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year\\'s end.\\n      \"The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening\\n  policy to defend the dollar,\" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He\\n  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.\\n  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures\\n  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  \\n  \\n\\n',\n",
