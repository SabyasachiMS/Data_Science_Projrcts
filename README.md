# Data_Science_Projects

Project-1
Build an Image Classifier for Plant Species Identification
In this machine learning project, we will use binary leaf images and extracted features, including shape, margin, and texture to accurately identify plant species using different benchmark classification techniques.


Project-2
Ecommerce product reviews - Pairwise ranking and sentiment analysis
This project analyzes a dataset containing ecommerce product reviews. The goal is to use machine learning models to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews and rank them based on relevance. Reviews play a key role in product recommendation systems.


Project-3
Perform Time series modelling using Facebook Prophet
In this project, we are going to talk about Time Series Forecasting to predict the electricity requirement for a particular house using Prophet.


Project-4
Data Science Project in Python on BigMart Sales Prediction
The goal of this data science project is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a given Big Mart store.


Project-5
Credit Card Fraud Detection as a Classification Problem
In this data science project, we will predict the credit card fraud in the transactional dataset using some of the predictive models.


Project-6
Human Activity Recognition Using Multiclass Classification in Python 
In this human activity recognition project, we use multiclass classification machine learning techniques to analyse fitness dataset from a smartphone tracker.


Project-7
Learn to prepare data for your next machine learning project
Text data requires special preparation before you can start using it for any machine learning project.In this ML project, you will learn about applying Machine Learning models to create classifiers and learn how to make sense of textual data.


Project-8
Predict Employee Computer Access Needs in Python
Data Science Project in Python- Given his or her job role, predict employee access needs using amazon employee database.


Project-9
Machine Learning project for Retail Price Optimization
In this machine learning pricing project, we implement a retail price optimization algorithm using regression trees. This is one of the first steps to building a dynamic pricing model.
